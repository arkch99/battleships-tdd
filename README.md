# battleships-tdd

A Battleship game, designed following Test-Driven-Development(TDD). Offers single-player matches against a fair but (hopefully) intelligent AI.

Tests were written using Jest, and Sass was used to keep the CSS tidy. Uses webpack to manage all assets. The core functionality is subdivided into ES6 modules, which is transpiled using Babel.
